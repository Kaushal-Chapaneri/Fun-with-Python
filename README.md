# Fun-with-Python
I've created this repo to share some cool tricks we can do with python.
libraries used: selenium (https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
and you will need Chrome driver (http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

please review code before running it, because it will require some changes.
